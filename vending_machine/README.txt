To run the simulation, run roslaunch bwi_launch simulation.launch in one window, and roslaunch vending_machine simulation_gui another
This package contains code bases for a vending machine node, which uses a Raspberry Pi to control a simple vending machine in the lab, and 
a robot node, which communicates with both humans and the vending machine to get a snack order, send it to the vending machine, get the snack from
the vending machine, and deliver it to the human who requested it
Also in this package is a simulation of this process that uses the simulation sequence on line 1, and which is the most fleshed-out version 
of this project as of 5.12
Created by JosieKate Cooley, Jacqueline Gibson, and Ashvin Govil for CS378, Autonomous Intelligent Robotics (Freshman Research Initiative stream)
